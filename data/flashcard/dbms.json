    "question": "What is an index in a database?",
    "answer": "A data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table. It works like a book index, using pointers to quickly locate data without scanning every row."

    "question": "What is normalization?",
    "answer": "The process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them."

    "category": "dbms",
    "question": "What is ACID in databases?",
    "answer": "ACID stands for Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability. These are properties that guarantee database transactions are processed reliably, ensuring data integrity even in case of errors or system failures."

    "question": "What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?",
    "answer": "SQL databases are relational, use structured schemas, and support ACID transactions. NoSQL databases are non-relational, have flexible schemas, and are designed for horizontal scaling and handling unstructured data."

    "id": "dbms-6",
    "category": "dbms",
    "question": "What is a foreign key?",
    "answer": "A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table. It creates a link between two tables and enforces referential integrity by ensuring the value exists in the referenced table."

    "id": "dbms-7",
    "category": "dbms",
    "question": "What is database sharding?",
    "answer": "A database partitioning technique that splits large databases into smaller, faster, more manageable parts called shards. Each shard is held on a separate database server instance to spread the load."
  },
  {
    "id": "dbms-8",
    "category": "dbms",
    "question": "What is a transaction?",
    "answer": "A sequence of database operations that are treated as a single unit of work. All operations must complete successfully, or none of them will be applied, ensuring data consistency."

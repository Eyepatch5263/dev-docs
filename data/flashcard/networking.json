        "answer": "Physical (cables, signals), Data Link (MAC, switches), Network (IP, routing), Transport (TCP/UDP, ports), Session (connections), Presentation (encryption, formatting), Application (HTTP, FTP). Mnemonic: Please Do Not Throw Sausage Pizza Away. Each layer adds headers/trailers for encapsulation.",

        "question": "What is the difference between TCP and UDP?",
        "answer": "TCP: connection-oriented, reliable, ordered delivery, flow control, slower (HTTP, FTP, SSH). UDP: connectionless, unreliable, no ordering, faster, lower overhead (DNS, streaming, gaming). TCP = phone call, UDP = text message. Choose based on reliability vs speed needs.",

        "question": "How does the TCP three-way handshake work?",
        "answer": "1) Client sends SYN (synchronize) with sequence number. 2) Server responds SYN-ACK (acknowledge). 3) Client sends ACK. Establishes connection, agrees on sequence numbers, ensures both sides ready. Termination uses four-way handshake (FIN, ACK, FIN, ACK).",

        "answer": "HTTP transmits data in plaintext over port 80, vulnerable to eavesdropping. HTTPS encrypts data using TLS/SSL over port 443, provides authentication, integrity, and confidentiality. HTTPS requires SSL certificate, slightly slower but essential for security, SEO ranking factor.",

        "answer": "ARP maps IP addresses to MAC addresses in local network. Process: 1) Broadcast ARP request 'Who has IP X?', 2) Device with IP X responds with MAC address, 3) Requester caches mapping. ARP table stores mappings. Reverse ARP (RARP) maps MAC to IP.",

        "answer": "Latency: time for data to travel from source to destination (milliseconds), affected by distance, routing, processing. Bandwidth: maximum data transfer rate (Mbps/Gbps), like pipe width. Low latency + high bandwidth = ideal. Latency = speed, bandwidth = capacity.",

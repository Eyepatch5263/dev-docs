# Introduction to System Design

System design is the process of defining the architecture, components, modules, interfaces, and data flow of a system to satisfy specified requirements. It's a critical skill for building scalable, reliable, and maintainable software systems.

## Why System Design Matters

Understanding system design is essential for:

- **Building Scalable Applications**: Handle millions of users without breaking
- **Ensuring Reliability**: Keep systems running even when things go wrong
- **Optimizing Performance**: Deliver fast response times and efficient resource usage
- **Making Informed Decisions**: Choose the right tools and architectures for the job

## Key Concepts

System design encompasses several fundamental areas:

### Scalability

The ability of a system to handle increased load by adding resources. This can be achieved through:

- Vertical scaling (adding more power to existing machines)
- Horizontal scaling (adding more machines)

### Reliability

Ensuring the system continues to work correctly even when faults occur. This involves:

- Redundancy
- Fault tolerance
- Graceful degradation

### Availability

The percentage of time a system is operational and accessible:

```
Availability = Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)
```

### Performance

How quickly and efficiently a system responds to requests:

- Latency (response time)
- Throughput (requests per second)

## Real-World Examples

### Netflix

Netflix handles over 200 million subscribers worldwide. Their architecture includes:

- Microservices architecture with hundreds of services
- CDN for content delivery
- Chaos engineering for resilience testing

### Twitter

Twitter processes over 500 million tweets per day using:

- Distributed caching (Redis)
- Message queues for async processing
- Sharded databases

## Getting Started

This documentation covers the essential topics you need to understand system design:

1. **Scalability** - Vertical vs horizontal scaling strategies
2. **Load Balancing** - Distributing traffic across servers
3. **Caching** - Speeding up data access
4. **Database Sharding** - Partitioning data for scale
5. **Message Queues** - Async communication patterns

Each topic builds on the previous ones, so we recommend reading them in order.
